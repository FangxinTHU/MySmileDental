	///<summary>A wrapper for the c# Thread class.  The purpose of this class is to help implement a well defined pattern throughout our applications.  It also allows us to better document threading where C# lacks documentation.  Since there is no way to get the list of managed threads for an application, the only way we can maintain a list is to do it ourselves.  The advantage of maintaining a list of managed threads is that we can much more easily ensure that all threads are gracefully quit when the program exits.</summary>
